## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Purple (#6750A4) to evoke feelings of wisdom and sophistication.
- Background color: Light gray (#F1F0F4) for a clean and professional look in light mode, with a darker variant (#303030) for dark mode.
- Accent color: Teal (#00A3A3) to provide visual contrast and highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and clean aesthetic. 'Inter' is used for both headlines and body text, given the short length of the text anticipated throughout this app.
- Use monochrome (grayscale) icons for services and platforms (Instagram, Viber, etc.) to maintain a clean and consistent look.
- Implement a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations for sidebar toggling, mode switching, and data loading to enhance user engagement without being intrusive.
